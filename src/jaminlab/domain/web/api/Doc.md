### **13. API Layer (API Gateway or Service Mesh)**

In microservices or complex distributed systems, the **API Gateway** or **Service Mesh** helps to manage communication between services and external consumers.

- **Responsibility**: Acts as a middle layer to simplify client-side communication, route requests, enforce security policies, and handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, etc.
- **Components**:
  - **API Gateway**: Handles routing, load balancing, API versioning, and security (e.g., **Kong**, **Zuul**, **AWS API Gateway**).
  - **Service Mesh**: Manages inter-service communication (e.g., **Istio**, **Linkerd**) in microservices architecture.
