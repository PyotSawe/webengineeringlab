;; --- Secret Key for Vault Operations ---
;; In production, it's essential to securely manage secret keys using a secure key store (e.g., AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault).
(def secret-key "my-super-secret-key")

;; --- Secure Password Handling ---
(defn hash-password [plain-password]
  (hashers/derive plain-password))

(defn verify-password [plain-password hashed-password]
  (hashers/check plain-password hashed-password))

;; --- Secure Storage (Using Encryption) ---
(defn encrypt-data [data]
  ;; Encrypt the data using a symmetric encryption algorithm (AES)
  (crypto/encrypt data secret-key))

(defn decrypt-data [encrypted-data]
  ;; Decrypt the data using the same encryption algorithm
  (crypto/decrypt encrypted-data secret-key))

;; --- Certificate Handling ---
(defn store-certificate [certificate-data certificate-path]
  ;; Store a certificate to a specific file location securely
  (spit certificate-path certificate-data))

(defn load-certificate [certificate-path]
  ;; Load a certificate from a given file path
  (slurp certificate-path))

(defn verify-certificate [certificate-path certificate-data]
  ;; A simple certificate verification using a basic checksum. Could integrate with proper libraries.
  (let [stored-cert (load-certificate certificate-path)]
    (= stored-cert certificate-data)))

;; --- Store & Retrieve Secrets (for other security info) ---
(defn store-secret [secret-name secret-value]
  ;; Encrypt and store a secret value in a file (or database)
  (let [encrypted-secret (encrypt-data secret-value)]
    (spit (str "secrets/" secret-name ".enc") encrypted-secret)))

(defn retrieve-secret [secret-name]
  ;; Decrypt and retrieve a stored secret
  (let [encrypted-secret (slurp (str "secrets/" secret-name ".enc"))]
    (decrypt-data encrypted-secret)))

;; --- Example Usage ---
;; Hashing password
(def hashed-password (hash-password "my-password"))

;; Verify password
(def password-verified? (verify-password "my-password" hashed-password))

;; Storing and verifying certificates
(def cert "my-certificate-data")
(store-certificate cert "certs/my-cert.pem")
(def cert-valid? (verify-certificate "certs/my-cert.pem" cert))

;; Secret storage and retrieval
(store-secret "api-key" "super-secret-api-key")
(def api-key (retrieve-secret "api-key"))
