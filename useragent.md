Yes, you can absolutely use libraries like `http-kit` to implement a **user agent** that connects to APIs. Hereâ€™s how you can design and implement a production-grade user agent using `http-kit` (or similar libraries) while making it extensible and robust:

---

### **Core Features of a User Agent**
A user agent for connecting to APIs typically needs the following features:

1. **Request Management:**
   - Handle GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., with customizable headers and body content.
   - Support JSON and other common data formats for requests and responses.

2. **Connection Management:**
   - Support persistent connections (Keep-Alive).
   - Enable timeout and retry logic for fault tolerance.

3. **Authentication:**
   - Handle API tokens, OAuth2, JWTs, and Basic Authentication.

4. **Session and Cookie Management:**
   - Manage sessions for authenticated APIs.
   - Store and send cookies automatically when required.

5. **Protocol Support:**
   - Support HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 (optionally HTTP/3 for cutting-edge APIs).

6. **Advanced Features:**
   - WebSocket connections for real-time APIs.
   - Rate limiting and throttling.
   - Proxy support for enterprise use cases.

---

### **Why Use `http-kit` for a User Agent?**
`http-kit` is a lightweight, asynchronous HTTP library well-suited for building user agents with features like:
- Non-blocking I/O for high concurrency.
- WebSocket support for real-time communication.
- Simple API for making HTTP requests.

However, if you need more advanced features (e.g., full HTTP/2 or QUIC support), consider integrating additional libraries like **Aleph**, **OkHttp**, or **Apache HttpClient**.

---

### **Steps to Build a User Agent with `http-kit`**

#### **1. Base HTTP Client**
Start by wrapping `http-kit`'s `http/request` to create a reusable client:
```clojure
(ns user-agent.core
  (:require [org.httpkit.client :as http]
            [cheshire.core :as json]))

(defn make-request
  [method url {:keys [headers params body timeout]}]
  (let [options {:method method
                 :url url
                 :headers headers
                 :query-params params
                 :body (when body (json/encode body))
                 :timeout (or timeout 5000)}]
    (http/request options)))

;; Example Usage
(make-request :get "https://api.example.com/data"
              {:headers {"Authorization" "Bearer token123"}
               :params {"q" "search-term"}})
```

---

#### **2. Add Authentication Support**
Extend your client to include authentication mechanisms like API keys, OAuth2, or JWT:
```clojure
(defn authenticated-request
  [method url opts auth-token]
  (let [headers (assoc (:headers opts) "Authorization" (str "Bearer " auth-token))]
    (make-request method url (assoc opts :headers headers))))

;; Example Usage
(authenticated-request :get "https://api.example.com/data"
                       {:params {"q" "search-term"}}
                       "token123")
```

---

#### **3. Session and Cookie Management**
Use a simple session store or implement cookies for APIs that require them:
```clojure
(def session-store (atom {}))

(defn update-session [cookies]
  (swap! session-store merge cookies))

(defn session-enabled-request
  [method url opts]
  (let [cookies (get @session-store "cookies")
        headers (assoc (:headers opts) "Cookie" cookies)]
    (let [{:keys [headers]} @(make-request method url (assoc opts :headers headers))]
      (update-session (get headers "Set-Cookie")))))
```

---

#### **4. WebSocket Support**
Real-time APIs often use WebSocket communication. `http-kit` makes this easy:
```clojure
(defn connect-websocket
  [url on-message]
  (http/websocket-client url {:on-receive on-message}))

;; Example Usage
(connect-websocket "wss://api.example.com/realtime"
                   (fn [msg] (println "Received:" msg)))
```

---

#### **5. Advanced Features**

- **Rate Limiting:**
   Use middleware to throttle requests:
   ```clojure
   (defn rate-limiter [f max-reqs interval]
     (let [counter (atom 0)]
       (fn [& args]
         (if (< @counter max-reqs)
           (do
             (swap! counter inc)
             (apply f args))
           (Thread/sleep interval)))))
   ```

- **Proxy Support:**
   Add proxy settings to `http-kit` options:
   ```clojure
   (defn proxy-request
     [method url opts proxy-host proxy-port]
     (make-request method url
                   (assoc opts :proxy-host proxy-host :proxy-port proxy-port)))
   ```

- **HTTP/2 and HTTP/3:**
   `http-kit` doesn't currently support HTTP/2 natively. For production use, you might want to use `Aleph` or `OkHttp` for advanced HTTP/2 or QUIC (HTTP/3) support.

---

### **Recommendations for Other HTTP Libraries**
1. **Aleph**:
   - Use Aleph if you need HTTP/2 or WebSocket multiplexing.
   - Suitable for real-time APIs or high-concurrency requirements.

2. **OkHttp** (via interop with Java):
   - Excellent for handling retries, redirects, and HTTP/2 out of the box.

3. **Jetty HTTP Client**:
   - Suitable for enterprise-grade production systems needing HTTP/2.

---

### **Final Considerations**
1. **Integration with APIs**:
   Build adapters for specific APIs that transform requests/responses into your domain model.
   
2. **Testing**:
   Use libraries like **clj-http-fake** or mocking tools to simulate API responses during development.

3. **Extensibility**:
   Modularize your client to add new features like custom caching, observability (e.g., logging), and tracing.
