Based on the comments and structure you've outlined for the different layers of your application, here are some suggestions for dependencies you can add to your `deps.edn` for each specific layer, along with the corresponding functionality and libraries:

---

### 1. **Sanity and Validation Layer**

For sanity checks and data validation, we typically use libraries that facilitate schema validation, data type checks, and other similar tasks. Based on your use case, here are a couple of useful libraries:

- **`clojure.spec.alpha`**: Provides a powerful and flexible way to define and validate data structures.
- **`malli`**: An alternative to `clojure.spec`, offering a more performance-oriented approach to data validation and schema generation.
- **`metosin/schema`**: Another schema validation library that can be useful for various forms of validation.

#### Example:
```clojure
:deps {clojure.spec.alpha {:mvn/version "0.2.194"}
       malli/malli {:mvn/version "0.11.0"}
       metosin/schema {:mvn/version "1.1.12"}}
```

---

### 2. **Web Layer**

For handling HTTP requests, routing, and web server functionalities, libraries like `reitit` and `ring` are popular. They provide clean abstractions for building web applications in Clojure.

- **`reitit`**: A fast, flexible, and simple routing library for Clojure and ClojureScript.
- **`ring`**: The de facto standard for Clojure web development, providing abstractions for HTTP requests and responses.
- **`http-kit`**: A high-performance, asynchronous HTTP server.
- **`pedestal`**: Provides a higher-level web framework, with an emphasis on architecture and extensibility.

#### Example:
```clojure
:deps {metosin/reitit {:mvn/version "0.5.16"}
       ring/ring-core {:mvn/version "1.9.4"}
       http-kit/http-kit {:mvn/version "2.5.3"}
       io.pedestal/pedestal.service {:mvn/version "0.5.9"}}
```

---

### 3. **Network Layer**

If you're working with network protocols, communication between services, or need to implement features like WebSockets, you could include:

- **`http-kit`**: For HTTP/WebSocket communication.
- **`langohr`**: A Clojure client for RabbitMQ, useful for messaging queues.
- **`clojure.core.async`**: Useful for handling asynchronous tasks, messaging, and parallelism.
- **`aleph`**: A more advanced network library built on top of `core.async` for web servers and HTTP clients.

#### Example:
```clojure
:deps {http-kit/http-kit {:mvn/version "2.5.3"}
       langohr/langohr {:mvn/version "5.1.0"}
       aleph/aleph {:mvn/version "0.4.7"}
       org.clojure/core.async {:mvn/version "1.5.648"}}
```

---

### 4. **Business/Application Layer**

The business logic layer may need libraries for defining core services, managing state, and enforcing business rules. For that, here are a few libraries that help with managing core application logic:

- **`compojure`**: A simple routing library for creating REST APIs.
- **`mount`**: Useful for managing application state and startup/shutdown logic.
- **`integrant`**: A more declarative configuration management library, useful for managing the life cycle of services and resources.

#### Example:
```clojure
:deps {compojure/compojure {:mvn/version "1.6.2"}
       mount/mount {:mvn/version "0.1.16"}
       integrant/integrant {:mvn/version "0.8.0"}}
```

---

### 5. **Security Layer**

For security, you mentioned some dependencies like `buddy` for signing, authentication, and hashing. Here are additional security-related libraries that may be helpful:

- **`buddy/buddy-hashers`**: For hashing passwords or other sensitive information.
- **`buddy/buddy-crypto`**: For cryptographic utilities like encryption and decryption.
- **`crypto-random`**: Useful for generating cryptographically secure random numbers, such as for password salts or JWT tokens.
- **`clojure.java-time`**: For time-sensitive operations like generating time-based tokens or handling expiry dates.

#### Example:
```clojure
:deps {buddy/buddy-sign {:mvn/version "3.6.1-359"}
       buddy/buddy-auth {:mvn/version "3.0.323"}
       buddy/buddy-hashers {:mvn/version "1.6.0"}
       buddy/buddy-core {:mvn/version "1.12.0-430"}
       crypto-random/crypto-random {:mvn/version "1.2.0"}}
```

---

### 6. **Configurations Layer**

For managing configurations, you've mentioned that you'd be using `clojure.edn` or something similar. The following libraries can help with managing and loading configurations, and possibly support environments:

- **`environ`**: For managing environment variables in Clojure.
- **`config`**: For loading configuration files (JSON, EDN, etc.).
- **`mount`**: Useful for managing lifecycle and configuration values in a more structured way.

#### Example:
```clojure
:deps {clojure.tools.logging {:mvn/version "1.2.4"}
       environ/environ {:mvn/version "1.2.0"}
       mount/mount {:mvn/version "0.1.16"}}
```

---

### 7. **Model Layer**

The model layer typically handles your core data structures (e.g., entities, schemas) and can include tools like `malli` or `schema` for validating those structures.

- **`malli`**: Schema definition and validation.
- **`spec`**: If you're using Clojure's built-in spec library.
- **`carmine`**: For interacting with Redis if that's a data source.
- **`next.jdbc`**: If you're using JDBC for database interactions.

#### Example:
```clojure
:deps {malli/malli {:mvn/version "0.11.0"}
       clojure.spec.alpha {:mvn/version "0.2.194"}
       next.jdbc/next.jdbc {:mvn/version "1.1.638"}}
```

---

### 8. **Persistence/Repository Layer**

For managing data persistence, repository patterns can include databases, file systems, or caching. Here's a selection of Clojure libraries useful for this layer:

- **`next.jdbc`**: A modern, performant library for interacting with SQL databases.
- **`clojure.java.jdbc`**: The original Clojure JDBC library for interacting with SQL databases.
- **`hugsql`**: A SQL library for writing SQL queries in Clojure.
- **`duct/duct`**: A more opinionated way to structure a Clojure app, including a built-in persistence layer.

#### Example:
```clojure
:deps {next.jdbc/next.jdbc {:mvn/version "1.1.638"}
       clojure.java.jdbc {:mvn/version "0.7.12"}
       duct/duct {:mvn/version "0.6.0"}
       hugsql/hugsql {:mvn/version "0.5.1"}}
```

---

### 9. **Integration Layer**

This would deal with connecting your application to external services, APIs, and messaging systems. Here are some common libraries for integration:

- **`langohr`**: For RabbitMQ integration.
- **`clj-http`**: For HTTP client interactions.
- **`ring/ring-jetty-adapter`**: For running a web server.
- **`korma`**: For ORM-based database integration.

#### Example:
```clojure
:deps {langohr/langohr {:mvn/version "5.1.0"}
       clj-http/clj-http {:mvn/version "3.12.3"}
       ring/ring-jetty-adapter {:mvn/version "1.9.4"}}
```

---

### 10. **Time Layer**

Time management libraries, such as `clojure.java-time`, help with time-related operations.

- **`clojure.java-time`**: A comprehensive library for working with dates and times in Java, based on the `java.time` package.
- **`tick`**: A Clojure library for working with time and intervals.

#### Example:
```clojure
:deps {clojure.java-time/clojure.java-time {:mvn/version "1.4.3"}
       tick/tick {:mvn/version "0.5.0"}}
```
