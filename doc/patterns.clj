Certainly! Expanding on the service layer design creatively, we can incorporate various **patterns** and **best practices** that enhance modularity, maintainability, and scalability of a Clojure-based application. These patterns will cover different aspects such as orchestration, transaction management, validation, and error handling, while integrating the domain model seamlessly with the repository layer and beyond.

### Expanded Service Layer Design: A Pattern-Oriented Approach

We'll explore several key service layer **patterns** that are common in software design and adapt them to a Clojure context, including:

1. **Facade Pattern**
2. **Template Method Pattern**
3. **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**
4. **Strategy Pattern**
5. **Transaction Script Pattern**
6. **Unit of Work Pattern**
7. **Lazy Load / Caching**
8. **Observer Pattern**
9. **DTO Pattern**
10. **Service Layer with Event-driven Architecture**

Let’s dive into each pattern, providing both explanations and Clojure-specific examples.

---

### 1. **Facade Pattern**

The **Facade** pattern is used to simplify interactions with complex subsystems or multiple services. It provides a unified interface to a set of services, thus reducing dependencies between various components in the system.

#### Example:

In the context of user management, we could expose a single entry point for creating users, handling their roles, and associated actions (like password resets), hiding the complexity of interacting with the database or validation layers.

```clojure
(ns jaminlab.domain.services.users.facade
  (:require [jaminlab.domain.services.users :as user-services]
            [jaminlab.domain.services.roles :as role-services]))

(defn create-user-with-role
  "Creates a user and assigns a role, wrapped into a single high-level operation."
  [user-data role-name]
  (let [user-response (user-services/create-user user-data)
        role-response (role-services/assign-role-to-user (:user-id user-response) role-name)]
    (if (and (= (:status user-response) 201) (= (:status role-response) 200))
      {:status 201 :body {:message "User created and role assigned successfully"}}
      {:status 400 :body {:error "User creation or role assignment failed"}})))
```

Here, `create-user-with-role` acts as a facade for multiple underlying operations, providing a simplified interface.

---

### 2. **Template Method Pattern**

The **Template Method** pattern defines the structure of an operation in the base class and allows subclasses to implement specific steps. This is useful when you have a base structure for operations but need flexibility in certain stages.

#### Example:

Let’s assume we have a common structure for operations like **create** and **update**.

```clojure
(defn validate-and-save [entity schema db save-fn]
  "Template method for validating and saving an entity."
  [entity]
  (if (s/valid? schema entity)
    (do
      (save-fn db entity)   ;; Call save function (could be insert or update)
      {:status 200 :body entity})
    {:status 400 :body {:error "Invalid data"}}))

(defn create-user [user-data]
  (validate-and-save user-data ::schemas/user-db repo/insert-user!))

(defn update-user [user-data]
  (validate-and-save user-data ::schemas/user-db repo/update-user!))
```

Here, the `validate-and-save` function acts as a template method, defining the structure of the validation and saving process. The actual `save-fn` (insert or update) is passed as a parameter to allow flexibility.

---

### 3. **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**

In the **Chain of Responsibility** pattern, multiple handlers are chained together, and each handler in the chain can either process the request or pass it along to the next handler. This is useful for sequential processing.

#### Example:

Suppose we have different validation stages for user creation (e.g., validating email, password strength, etc.).

```clojure
(defn validate-email [user]
  (if (re-matches #".+@.+\..+" (:email user))
    user
    (throw (ex-info "Invalid email format" {:user user}))))

(defn validate-password [user]
  (if (>= (count (:password user)) 8)
    user
    (throw (ex-info "Password too short" {:user user}))))

(defn create-user [user-data]
  (let [valid-user (-> user-data
                       validate-email
                       validate-password)]
    (repo/insert-user! valid-user)))
```

Each function (`validate-email`, `validate-password`) acts as a handler, passing the user data along the chain, and each handler can decide whether to process or throw an error.

---

### 4. **Strategy Pattern**

The **Strategy** pattern allows a method to choose its behavior dynamically by selecting from a set of strategies. This is especially useful when you have multiple ways of performing an operation, such as different ways of calculating user rankings or applying discounts.

#### Example:

Let's implement dynamic email validation strategies based on user type.

```clojure
(defn validate-email-standard [email]
  (re-matches #".+@.+\..+" email))

(defn validate-email-corporate [email]
  (re-matches #".+@company\.com" email))

(defn validate-user-email [user email-strategy]
  (email-strategy (:email user)))

(defn create-user [user-data]
  (let [email-validator (if (= (:role user-data) "corporate")
                          validate-email-corporate
                          validate-email-standard)]
    (if (email-validator user-data)
      (repo/insert-user! user-data)
      {:status 400 :body {:error "Invalid email"}})))
```

Here, the `validate-user-email` function dynamically selects the appropriate validation strategy based on the user’s role.

---

### 5. **Transaction Script Pattern**

In the **Transaction Script** pattern, each function is responsible for handling a specific transaction or business process. This pattern is often used for simple CRUD operations or workflows.

#### Example:

Let’s implement a `create-order` service.

```clojure
(defn create-order [order-data]
  (let [order (map->Order order-data)]
    (if (s/valid? ::schemas/order-db order)
      (do
        (repo/insert-order! order)
        {:status 201 :body order})
      {:status 400 :body {:error "Invalid order data"}})))
```

This is a **transaction script** because it handles a single transaction (creating an order) in a simple, linear manner.

---

### 6. **Unit of Work Pattern**

The **Unit of Work** pattern helps manage transactions and ensures that all changes to data are committed or rolled back together. It is particularly useful for handling complex interactions that involve multiple repositories or entities.

#### Example:

```clojure
(defn unit-of-work [db-fn & actions]
  "Execute a series of actions as a single unit of work."
  (let [tx (repo/start-transaction)]
    (try
      (doseq [action actions]
        (action tx))   ;; Execute actions within the transaction context
      (repo/commit-transaction tx)
      {:status 200 :body {:message "Transaction completed successfully"}})
    (catch Exception e
      (repo/rollback-transaction tx)
      {:status 500 :body {:error "Transaction failed" :message (.getMessage e)}})))

(defn create-user-and-order [user-data order-data]
  (unit-of-work repo/start-transaction
                #(repo/insert-user! % user-data)
                #(repo/insert-order! % order-data)))
```

In the example, `unit-of-work` manages the transaction lifecycle, ensuring both the user and order are created in one transaction.

---

### 7. **Lazy Load / Caching Pattern**

In certain scenarios, it may be beneficial to cache or lazily load expensive data. The **Lazy Load / Caching** pattern can improve performance, especially for frequently accessed data.

#### Example:

```clojure
(def user-cache (atom {}))

(defn get-user [user-id]
  (if-let [cached-user (@user-cache user-id)]
    cached-user
    (let [user (repo/get-user-by-id {:user-id user-id})]
      (swap! user-cache assoc user-id user)
      user)))
```

This example implements a **lazy-loading cache** that stores user data in memory to avoid fetching it from the database multiple times.

---

### 8. **Observer Pattern**

The **Observer** pattern is useful for scenarios where you want to notify other components when certain actions occur, such as after user creation or data changes.

#### Example:

```clojure
(defn send-welcome-email [user]
  ;; Send email logic here
  )

(def observers (atom [send-welcome-email]))

(defn create-user [user-data]
  (let [user (map->User user-data)]
    (repo/insert-user! user)
    (doseq [observer @observers]
      (observer user)) ;; Notify observers after user creation
    {:status 201 :body user}))
```

In this example, observers (like `send-welcome-email`) are notified whenever a user is created.

---

### 9. **DTO Pattern**

A **DTO (Data Transfer Object)** pattern is used to transfer data between layers or components. It is often used to optimize network communication by reducing the number of attributes and creating simplified objects for transferring.

#### Example:

```clojure
(defn user-dto [user]
  (select-keys user [:user-id :username :email]))

(defn get-user [user-id]
  (let [user (repo/get-user-by-id {:user

-id user-id})]
    (user-dto user)))
```

The `user-dto` function creates a simplified view of the `user` object to be used in API responses.

---

### 10. **Service Layer with Event-driven Architecture**

In event-driven systems, the **Service Layer** is responsible for coordinating services and dispatching events to relevant handlers.

#### Example:

```clojure
(defn dispatch-event [event]
  ;; Publish event to message bus or event stream
  )

(defn create-user [user-data]
  (let [user (map->User user-data)]
    (repo/insert-user! user)
    (dispatch-event {:event-type :user-created :user-id (:user-id user)})
    {:status 201 :body user}))
```

This design integrates an event-driven architecture into the service layer, where events are dispatched after actions.

---

These are just a few patterns, and their implementations can grow as the complexity of your system increases. Each pattern provides flexibility in designing a robust and scalable service layer that aligns with clean code principles.
