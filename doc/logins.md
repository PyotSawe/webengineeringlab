To extend the middleware logic for handling login authentication, including managing user access and applying ABAC or role-based policies, we can integrate the authentication and authorization logic within a centralized login handler. Here's how we can adjust and add middleware for your login flow:

### 1. **Update Login Handler**

You can update the login handler to include all required checks like rate-limiting, password verification, and the subsequent role-based or ABAC authorization checks. This handler will be responsible for verifying the user's credentials, logging attempts, and finally granting access based on roles or ABAC rules.

### 2. **Integration of Middleware in Login Flow**

Let’s first define a centralized `login-handler`, which will integrate all the middlewares:

```clojure
(ns jaminlab.domain.security.handlers
  (:require
   [jaminlab.domain.security.vaults :as vaults]
   [jaminlab.domain.security.middlewares :as middlewares]
   [buddy.auth :as auth]
   [clojure.tools.logging :as log]))

(defn login-handler [request]
  (let [user-id (get-in request [:params :user-id])
        password (get-in request [:params :password])
        login-result (vaults/check-password user-id password)]
    (if login-result
      (let [token (auth/generate-token {:user-id user-id})] ;; Generate JWT token after successful login
        (log/info (str "User " user-id " logged in successfully"))
        {:status 200
         :body {:message "Login successful"
                :token token}})
      (do
        (vaults/log-failed-login user-id)
        {:status 401
         :body {:error "Invalid credentials"}}))))

;; Combine middlewares for login
(defn login-with-middleware [request]
  (-> (fn [req] (login-handler req))   ;; Main login handler
      (middlewares/rate-limit)         ;; Rate limiting middleware
      (middlewares/dynamic-scope-authorization))) ;; Optional: Apply dynamic scope authorization
```

This `login-with-middleware` handler first applies the `rate-limit` middleware to prevent brute force attacks, then dynamically checks scopes (if you want to check permissions based on the user’s scopes).

### 3. **Enhancing Middleware**

Here’s an updated approach to adding additional layers to the login flow and ensuring that access is properly controlled by roles or ABAC policies:

#### Role-based Authorization Middleware

Ensure roles are checked after the user logs in. This would be done by adding role checks after the JWT authentication:

```clojure
(defn wrap-role-authorization [handler required-roles]
  (fn [request]
    (let [user (auth/current-authentication)]
      (if (some #(contains? (set (:roles user)) %) required-roles)
        (handler request)
        {:status 403
         :body {:error "Forbidden: Insufficient permissions"}}))))
```

This can be added to the `login-handler` to ensure that the user has the correct roles before proceeding.

#### ABAC-Based Authorization Middleware

For more fine-grained access control, use ABAC policies as part of your middleware chain:

```clojure
(defn wrap-abac-authorization [handler policies]
  (fn [request]
    (let [user (auth/current-authentication)
          resource (:resource request)
          context {:ip (:remote-addr request)
                   :time (java.time.Instant/now)}]
      (if (abac/evaluate-policy user resource context policies)
        (handler request)
        {:status 403
         :body {:error "Forbidden: Access denied by ABAC policy"}}))))
```

This middleware can be used to control access based on policies evaluated dynamically for each request.

### 4. **Updated Login Flow with ABAC and Role-Based Authorization**

Now, to integrate ABAC and roles into the login process, combine all relevant middlewares in sequence:

```clojure
(defn login-with-full-authorization [request]
  (-> (fn [req] (login-handler req))   ;; Main login handler
      (middlewares/rate-limit)         ;; Rate limiting middleware
      (middlewares/dynamic-scope-authorization) ;; Dynamic scope authorization
      (middlewares/wrap-role-authorization [:admin :user]) ;; Role-based access control
      (middlewares/wrap-abac-authorization policies)))  ;; ABAC-based access control
```

### 5. **Example Usage**

Here's how the login handler with full middleware could be invoked in your application:

```clojure
(def app
  (wrap-jwt-auth
    (fn [request]
      (login-with-full-authorization request))))
```

In this flow:
- **Rate Limiting** ensures users cannot make excessive requests.
- **JWT Authentication** validates the token from the request headers.
- **Role-based Authorization** ensures only users with certain roles can access resources.
- **ABAC** evaluates access based on dynamic policies.

### 6. **Token Generation**

You’ll need a mechanism to generate and issue JWT tokens on successful login. You can integrate the following method:

```clojure
(ns jaminlab.domain.security.jwt
  (:require [buddy.auth :as auth]))

(defn generate-token [user]
  (let [claims {:user-id (:user-id user)
                :roles (:roles user)}]
    (auth/sign claims {:key "your-secret-key"})))
```

This will generate a JWT token using the user’s roles and other relevant claims, and you can use this token to authorize further requests.
