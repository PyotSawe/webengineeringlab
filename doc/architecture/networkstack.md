To implement a complete **network stack for a browser** ready for production, we must design it with modularity, robustness, and scalability in mind. Below is the detailed architecture, components, and features needed for a production-grade network stack.

---

## **Key Objectives for the Network Stack**
1. **Protocol Support**: Support for HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3, and WebSocket.
2. **Advanced Features**: Proxy handling, caching, cookie management, and secure connections.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Multiplexing, connection pooling, DNS caching, and adaptive streaming.
4. **Security**: TLS/SSL, certificate validation, and modern authentication methods (OAuth2, JWT).
5. **Web3 Ready**: Integration with decentralized protocols (e.g., IPFS, blockchain RPC).

---

## **Proposed Architecture**

### **Layered Design**

1. **Application Layer**:
   - Responsible for interpreting URLs, headers, and application-level data.
   - Modules: Request Building, Response Handling, Cookie Management, Redirects.

2. **Session Layer**:
   - Manages persistent connections (e.g., keep-alive, connection pooling).
   - Modules: Connection Pool, Session State.

3. **Transport Layer**:
   - Handles data transfer reliability (TCP, QUIC).
   - Modules: HTTP/2 Multiplexing, QUIC Integration.

4. **Network Layer**:
   - Manages DNS resolution and IP communication.
   - Modules: DNS Cache, Proxy Support.

5. **Security Layer**:
   - Ensures secure communication via TLS/SSL and certificate validation.
   - Modules: Certificate Store, Encryption.

## **Detailed Components**

### **1. Application Layer**

#### Modules:
- **Request Builder**:
  - Converts high-level browser requests into HTTP requests.
  - Handles headers, cookies, and query strings.
- **Response Handler**:
  - Interprets HTTP responses, including status codes, headers, and body.
  - Handles redirects, chunked encoding, and gzip compression.
- **Cookie Manager**:
  - Stores, updates, and retrieves cookies per domain.
  - Adheres to browser security policies (SameSite, Secure flags).

#### Technologies:
- Use `clj-http` or `aleph` for initial prototyping.
- Implement a custom parser for fine-grained control.

---

### **2. Session Layer**

#### Modules:
- **Connection Pool**:
  - Reuses connections for the same host to improve performance.
  - Implements HTTP/2 multiplexing for multiple streams.
- **Session State Manager**:
  - Tracks active sessions and associated cookies, headers, etc.

#### Technologies:
- Integrate `core.async` for lightweight thread management.

---

### **3. Transport Layer**

#### Modules:
- **HTTP/1.1**:
  - Implements basic request-response mechanism with keep-alive.
- **HTTP/2**:
  - Multiplexing support for parallel streams.
  - Header compression (HPACK).
- **HTTP/3**:
  - Integrates QUIC for low-latency and reliable communication.
- **WebSocket**:
  - Full-duplex communication for real-time applications.

#### Technologies:
- Use libraries like `hato` for HTTP/1.1, or implement HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 from scratch using QUIC libraries (e.g., `quiche` in Rust, `netty` in Java).
- **QUIC Integration**:
  - Bind Rust-based QUIC libraries using `jni` for performance.

---

### **4. Network Layer**

#### Modules:
- **DNS Resolver**:
  - Caches DNS lookups for faster repeat access.
  - Handles DNS over HTTPS (DoH) for privacy.
- **Proxy Support**:
  - Configurable for HTTP, HTTPS, and SOCKS proxies.

#### Technologies:
- Use `dnsjava` for DNS resolution.
- Implement DNS cache in a distributed system for scalability.

---

### **5. Security Layer**

#### Modules:
- **TLS/SSL Handler**:
  - Handles secure connections.
  - Performs certificate validation and revocation checks (CRL, OCSP).
- **Authentication**:
  - Implements OAuth2 flows (implicit, authorization code, and PKCE).
  - Supports modern authentication mechanisms like JWT.

#### Technologies:
- Java's `SSLContext` for TLS integration.
- Use libraries like `keycloak` for OAuth2.

```

## **Performance Optimizations**

1. **Connection Reuse**: Implement connection pooling at the session layer.
2. **Multiplexing**: HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 allow multiple requests over a single connection.
3. **Caching**:
   - DNS caching for faster lookups.
   - HTTP caching for static resources (ETag, Last-Modified headers).
4. **Compression**: Gzip and Brotli for response body compression.
5. **Streaming**: Adaptive streaming for large payloads (e.g., video content).

---

## **Development Roadmap**

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
- Implement basic HTTP/1.1 and WebSocket modules.
- Integrate a simple TLS/SSL handler.

### Phase 2: Performance & Security
- Add support for HTTP/2 and connection pooling.
- Implement certificate validation and DNS over HTTPS.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Build HTTP/3 using QUIC.
- Integrate Web3 protocols (IPFS, Ethereum RPC).

### Phase 4: Production Readiness
- Extensive testing with real-world websites.
- Add metrics and logging for performance monitoring.
