The **config** layer in a Clojure application typically contains configuration data that is needed for your system to operate correctly, such as environment variables, database connection details, service configurations, third-party API keys, and other runtime settings. It centralizes all configuration management, helping you to easily change settings without modifying your application logic.

### What to include under `config`:

Here’s a general outline of what you should include in the `config` directory/module of your application:

---

### 1. **Environment Configuration**
Environment-specific configurations should be placed here. This is typically where you store variables that change based on your environment (e.g., local, staging, production). Common configurations include:

- **Database connection settings** (e.g., database URL, username, password, port).
- **API keys** for third-party services (e.g., payment gateways, external APIs).
- **Service configurations** (e.g., base URLs for microservices, timeouts).
- **Logging configurations** (e.g., log level, log formats, log storage).
- **Feature flags** (e.g., to enable/disable features in specific environments).
- **Queue or messaging system settings** (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka settings).
- **Security settings** (e.g., OAuth keys, JWT secret, encryption settings).

#### Example (`config.edn`):

```clojure
{:db {:url "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb"
      :username "user"
      :password "password"
      :driver-class "com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver"
      :max-pool-size 10}

 :logging {:level :info
           :log-file "/var/log/myapp.log"}

 :api-keys {:stripe "sk_test_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
            :sendgrid "SG.XxxxxxxxxX"}

 :features {:email-service true
            :payment-gateway false}

 :oauth {:client-id "your-client-id"
         :client-secret "your-client-secret"
         :redirect-uri "https://yourapp.com/oauth/callback"}
}
```

You can load this config in your Clojure application as needed, for example, using the `clojure.edn` reader or a configuration library.

---

### 2. **Centralized Configuration**
In larger applications, you may choose to centralize configuration loading and access. This is typically done with a configuration file (e.g., `config.edn`), and a loader function to read this file and apply it across the application.

#### Example (`config.clj`):

```clojure
(ns jaminlab.config
  (:require [clojure.edn :as edn]
            [clojure.java.io :as io]))

(def config-file "resources/config.edn")

(defn load-config []
  (edn/read-string (slurp (io/resource config-file))))

(defonce config (atom (load-config)))

(defn get-config []
  @config)

(defn get-db-config []
  (get-in @config [:db]))
```

This way, you can access any configuration values using `get-config` or specialized functions like `get-db-config` to retrieve database-specific settings.

---

### 3. **Logging Configuration**
Logging is a critical part of any application, so configuring logging properly in the config layer is important.

- **Log level** (e.g., `:debug`, `:info`, `:warn`, `:error`) can be specified here.
- **Log format** (e.g., JSON, plain text).
- **Log destination** (e.g., file, console, or external service).

You can use a Clojure logging library like `clojure.tools.logging` or a more robust solution like `logback` with `logback.xml` configuration.

#### Example (`logging.clj`):

```clojure
(ns jaminlab.config.logging
  (:require [clojure.tools.logging :as log]))

(defn configure-logging []
  (log/info "Configuring logging...")
  ;; Configure logging settings based on the environment or config.edn
  ;; You can use Logback or other logging libraries here for more advanced configurations
  )
```

---

### 4. **Database Configuration**
If you are using a database, you will likely want to store the database configuration in a central place. This can include:

- **Connection pooling** (e.g., max connections, idle time).
- **Schema details** (e.g., auto-migrations, versions).
- **Data sources** (e.g., multiple databases for read and write, multi-tenant setups).

You can leverage Clojure libraries like `clojure.java.jdbc`, `hikari-cp`, or `next.jdbc` to manage database connections.

#### Example (`db.clj`):

```clojure
(ns jaminlab.config.db
  (:require [next.jdbc :as jdbc]
            [jaminlab.config :as config]))

(def db-config (config/get-db-config))

(def datasource (jdbc/get-datasource db-config))

(defn get-conn []
  (jdbc/get-connection datasource))
```

This code sets up a database connection using the `next.jdbc` library and centralizes the database configuration.

---

### 5. **External Services Configuration**
For services like payments, messaging queues, or external APIs, you need to configure the API keys, URLs, and related settings. This allows you to easily switch or update services without changing the core logic.

#### Example (`external-services.clj`):

```clojure
(ns jaminlab.config.external-services
  (:require [jaminlab.config :as config]))

(def stripe-api-key (:stripe (config/get-config)))

(defn get-stripe-client []
  ;; Create and return Stripe client using the API key
  )

(defn get-sendgrid-client []
  ;; Create and return SendGrid client using the API key
  )
```

---

### 6. **Feature Toggles / Flags**
Feature toggles allow you to enable or disable certain features at runtime. This is helpful for deploying partial functionality, testing features in production, or doing gradual rollouts.

You can define the feature flags in your `config.edn` and then check them dynamically in your services.

#### Example (`feature-flags.clj`):

```clojure
(ns jaminlab.config.feature-flags
  (:require [jaminlab.config :as config]))

(defn feature-enabled? [feature]
  (get-in (config/get-config) [:features feature]))

(defn create-user []
  (if (feature-enabled? :email-service)
    ;; Call email service
    (send-email)
    ;; Skip email service
    ))
```

---

### 7. **Security Configuration**
Security-related configurations are essential for an application to function securely. This includes encryption keys, OAuth tokens, JWT secrets, etc.

#### Example (`security.clj`):

```clojure
(ns jaminlab.config.security
  (:require [jaminlab.config :as config]))

(def jwt-secret (:jwt-secret (config/get-config)))

(defn generate-jwt-token [user]
  ;; Generate JWT token using the secret
  )
```

---

### 8. **Caching Configuration**
For performance optimization, caching is a common pattern, especially when interacting with external APIs or databases. Caching configurations could include cache expiration times, maximum cache size, and whether the cache is enabled or not.

#### Example (`caching.clj`):

```clojure
(ns jaminlab.config.caching
  (:require [jaminlab.config :as config]))

(def cache-config (get-in (config/get-config) [:caching]))

(defn should-cache? []
  (:enabled cache-config))

(defn cache-value [key value]
  ;; Cache the value based on the caching configuration
  )
```

---

### 9. **Middleware Configuration**
In Clojure web applications, middleware is often used for logging, authentication, and other pre/post-processing logic. Middleware configuration might be centralized in your `config` layer.

#### Example (`middleware.clj`):

```clojure
(ns jaminlab.config.middleware
  (:require [jaminlab.config :as config]))

(defn wrap-authentication [handler]
  (fn [request]
    (if (authenticated? request)
      (handler request)
      {:status 401 :body "Unauthorized"})))

(defn wrap-logging [handler]
  (fn [request]
    (log/info "Request received" {:request request})
    (handler request)))
```

This allows you to centrally configure which middleware to apply based on the environment.

---

### 10. **Internationalization (i18n) Configuration**
If your application supports multiple languages, the configuration should include language packs, fallback strategies, and other internationalization settings.

#### Example (`i18n.clj`):

```clojure
(ns jaminlab.config.i18n
  (:require [clojure.java.io :as io]))

(def translations (atom {}))

(defn load-translations [lang]
  (reset! translations (read-string (slurp (io/resource (str "translations/" lang ".edn"))))))

(defn translate [key]
  (@translations key))
```

This allows you to load translations dynamically based on the user’s language preference.

---

### Conclusion

By structuring the `config` module in this way, you centralize the management of all runtime configurations, allowing your application to be flexible, modular, and easy to update. You can load configurations dynamically and adjust them per environment, making your application adaptable to different production, staging, or local environments. This setup also facilitates testing, as you can mock or modify configuration values during unit tests or in different deployment stages.
