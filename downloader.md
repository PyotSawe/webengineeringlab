Yes, you can add a **download manager module** to your user agent that enables downloading large files, similar to what Internet Download Manager (IDM) does. Here’s how you can design and implement this module with robust features:

---

### **Features of a Download Manager**
To mimic the functionality of IDM, your download module should support:

1. **Resumable Downloads**:
   - Utilize the HTTP `Range` header to download specific byte ranges, enabling paused and resumed downloads.

2. **Concurrent Downloads**:
   - Divide files into chunks and download multiple chunks concurrently using threads or asynchronous tasks.

3. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Provide real-time updates on download progress, speed, and estimated time.

4. **Error Handling and Retries**:
   - Handle network interruptions gracefully and retry failed downloads.

5. **File Integrity Verification**:
   - Use checksums (MD5, SHA-256) to verify the integrity of downloaded files.

6. **Integration with Proxies**:
   - Support proxy settings for corporate or restricted environments.

---

### **Implementation Design**

#### **1. Architecture Overview**
The downloader module should:
- Be a standalone component in the user agent.
- Use `http-kit` or another HTTP library for making ranged requests.
- Support asynchronous tasks for chunked downloads.

The module can consist of the following parts:
- **Downloader Core**: Manages download logic and HTTP requests.
- **Chunk Manager**: Handles splitting files into chunks.
- **Progress Monitor**: Tracks download progress and reports updates.
- **Error and Retry Handler**: Manages failures and retries.

---

#### **2. Implementation Steps**

##### **Core HTTP Request for Download**
Use the HTTP `Range` header for partial file downloads:
```clojure
(ns user-agent.downloader
  (:require [org.httpkit.client :as http]))

(defn download-chunk
  "Downloads a specific byte range from the file."
  [url start end output-file]
  (let [options {:method :get
                 :headers {"Range" (str "bytes=" start "-" end)}
                 :timeout 60000}]
    (http/request url
                  (fn [{:keys [status body]}]
                    (if (= status 206)
                      (spit output-file body :append true)
                      (println "Error downloading chunk"))))))
```

---

##### **Chunked Downloads with Concurrency**
Divide the file into chunks and download them concurrently:
```clojure
(defn split-into-chunks
  "Splits a file of size `total-size` into chunks of `chunk-size` bytes."
  [total-size chunk-size]
  (let [num-chunks (Math/ceil (/ total-size chunk-size))]
    (map (fn [i]
           {:start (* i chunk-size)
            :end (min total-size (* (inc i) chunk-size) - 1)})
         (range num-chunks))))

(defn download-file
  "Downloads a file in parallel using multiple chunks."
  [url output-file chunk-size]
  (let [total-size (get-file-size url) ;; Implement this to fetch Content-Length
        chunks (split-into-chunks total-size chunk-size)]
    (doseq [chunk chunks]
      (download-chunk url (:start chunk) (:end chunk) output-file))))
```

---

##### **Resumable Downloads**
Store the progress in a temporary file and continue downloading from the last position:
```clojure
(defn get-last-byte
  "Reads the last byte position from the progress file."
  [progress-file]
  (if (.exists (java.io.File. progress-file))
    (slurp progress-file)
    0))

(defn save-progress
  "Saves the last byte position to a progress file."
  [progress-file position]
  (spit progress-file position))

(defn resume-download
  "Resumes downloading a file from the last byte position."
  [url output-file progress-file chunk-size]
  (let [last-byte (get-last-byte progress-file)]
    (download-file url output-file chunk-size)))
```

---

##### **Progress Tracking**
Use an atom or similar structure to track and display progress:
```clojure
(def progress (atom {:total 0 :downloaded 0}))

(defn update-progress
  "Updates the progress tracker."
  [bytes]
  (swap! progress update :downloaded + bytes))

(defn show-progress
  "Displays the current progress."
  []
  (let [{:keys [total downloaded]} @progress]
    (println (str "Progress: " (int (/ downloaded total 100)) "%"))))
```

---

##### **Error Handling and Retries**
Retry failed chunks with exponential backoff:
```clojure
(defn retry-download
  [url start end output-file retries]
  (loop [attempt 1]
    (let [result (download-chunk url start end output-file)]
      (if (or (= (:status result) 206)
              (>= attempt retries))
        result
        (do
          (Thread/sleep (* 1000 attempt)) ;; Exponential backoff
          (recur (inc attempt)))))))
```

---

#### **3. Final Wrapper for File Download**
Combine all the features into a cohesive API:
```clojure
(defn download
  "Downloads a file with all features."
  [url output-file progress-file chunk-size retries]
  (let [last-byte (get-last-byte progress-file)
        total-size (get-file-size url)
        chunks (split-into-chunks (- total-size last-byte) chunk-size)]
    (doseq [chunk chunks]
      (retry-download url (:start chunk) (:end chunk) output-file retries)
      (save-progress progress-file (:end chunk))
      (update-progress (- (:end chunk) (:start chunk)))))
  (show-progress))
```

---

### **Libraries to Explore**
While `http-kit` can handle most of this, you might want to consider:
1. **Aleph**: For HTTP/2 or WebSocket support in downloads.
2. **Apache Commons FileDownload**: For Java interop and robust features.
3. **OkHttp**: For advanced HTTP/2 support and easy file handling.

---

### **Additional Enhancements**
1. **Multi-threaded Downloads**:
   Use `future` or core.async for better concurrency control.
   
2. **Checksum Verification**:
   Add MD5 or SHA-256 verification after the download completes.

3. **UI Integration**:
   Provide a GUI/CLI for user interaction (e.g., pause, resume, cancel).

4. **Logging and Metrics**:
   Use a logging library to track errors, progress, and performance metrics.

Would you like detailed code for multi-threading or checksum handling? Or should we focus on integrating this into a larger user-agent framework?
<!-- LEVEL 2 -->
Let’s focus on additional enhancements to make the **download manager module** production-ready with robust features. Here’s a detailed implementation plan for each enhancement:

---

### **1. Multi-threaded Downloads**

Multi-threaded downloads improve speed by dividing the file into chunks and downloading them in parallel. This can be implemented with **Clojure's `future`** or **core.async channels**.

#### **Implementation Using `future`**
```clojure
(defn parallel-download
  "Downloads file chunks in parallel using futures."
  [url output-file chunk-size]
  (let [total-size (get-file-size url) ;; Fetch total file size using HEAD request
        chunks (split-into-chunks total-size chunk-size)
        threads (map (fn [chunk]
                       (future
                         (download-chunk url (:start chunk) (:end chunk) output-file)))
                     chunks)]
    ;; Wait for all threads to complete
    (doseq [t threads]
      @t)))
```

#### **Implementation Using `core.async`**
Core.async provides more control for managing concurrency, retries, and dynamic progress reporting.

```clojure
(require '[clojure.core.async :refer [go chan <! >! pipeline-blocking]])

(defn async-download
  "Downloads file chunks asynchronously using core.async."
  [url output-file chunk-size]
  (let [total-size (get-file-size url)
        chunks (split-into-chunks total-size chunk-size)
        results (chan 10)] ;; Buffer of size 10
    ;; Start the pipeline for concurrent downloads
    (pipeline-blocking 5 ;; Number of concurrent threads
                       results
                       (map (fn [chunk]
                              (download-chunk url (:start chunk) (:end chunk) output-file)))
                       chunks)
    ;; Consume results
    (go
      (while true
        (let [result (<! results)]
          (println "Chunk download result:" result)))))) 
```

---

### **2. Checksum Verification**

Use MD5 or SHA-256 to verify file integrity after download completion.

#### **Compute File Checksum**
```clojure
(require '[clojure.java.io :as io]
         '[clojure.data.codec.base64 :as b64]
         '[digest :as digest]) ;; Include a library like clj-digest

(defn compute-checksum
  "Computes the checksum of the downloaded file."
  [file-path algorithm]
  (digest/file algorithm (io/file file-path)))
```

#### **Validate Checksum**
Compare the computed checksum with the expected value:
```clojure
(defn verify-checksum
  "Verifies the checksum of a file."
  [file-path expected-checksum algorithm]
  (let [actual-checksum (compute-checksum file-path algorithm)]
    (if (= actual-checksum expected-checksum)
      (println "File integrity verified successfully!")
      (throw (Exception. "Checksum mismatch! File may be corrupted.")))))
```

---

### **3. GUI/CLI Integration**

Integrate a **progress tracker** into a UI/CLI to display real-time download statistics.

#### **CLI Example**
```clojure
(defn show-progress-cli
  "Displays download progress in the CLI."
  [progress]
  (let [{:keys [downloaded total]} @progress]
    (println (str "Downloaded: " downloaded " / " total
                  " (" (int (/ downloaded total 100)) "%)"))))

;; Call this periodically in a loop or on each chunk completion:
(show-progress-cli progress)
```

#### **GUI Integration**
Use **HumbleUI** or **JavaFX** to create a download progress bar:
```clojure
(ns downloader.gui
  (:require [humble-ui.core :as ui]))

(defn progress-ui
  "Renders a simple progress bar."
  [progress]
  (let [{:keys [downloaded total]} @progress
        percentage (int (/ downloaded total 100))]
    (ui/vstack
      (ui/label (str "Download Progress: " percentage "%"))
      (ui/progress-bar :value percentage))))
```

---

### **4. Logging and Metrics**

Use a logging library like **timbre** for detailed logs of downloads, including retries, failures, and performance metrics.

#### **Logging Setup**
```clojure
(require '[taoensso.timbre :as log])

(defn log-download
  "Logs download events."
  [event details]
  (log/info (str "Event: " event " | Details: " details)))

(log-download "Start" {:url url :chunk-start 0 :chunk-end 10000})
```

---

### **5. Retry Strategy with Backoff**

Implement **exponential backoff** for failed downloads to avoid overloading the server.

#### **Retry with Backoff**
```clojure
(defn retry-with-backoff
  "Retries download with exponential backoff."
  [url start end output-file retries]
  (loop [attempt 1]
    (let [result (download-chunk url start end output-file)]
      (if (or (= (:status result) 206)
              (>= attempt retries))
        result
        (do
          (println (str "Retrying... Attempt " attempt))
          (Thread/sleep (* 1000 (Math/pow 2 attempt))) ;; Backoff
          (recur (inc attempt)))))))
```

---

### **6. Proxy and Advanced Features**

Enable support for proxy connections and download acceleration.

#### **Proxy Support**
Set proxy options in your HTTP library (e.g., `http-kit`):
```clojure
(defn download-with-proxy
  [url proxy-host proxy-port]
  (http/request {:url url
                 :proxy {:host proxy-host
                         :port proxy-port}}))
```

#### **Download Acceleration**
Use multiple concurrent HTTP connections for a single file to speed up downloads. This involves:
- Dividing the file into smaller chunks.
- Ensuring chunks are downloaded from separate threads.
- Reassembling the file.

---

### **7. Final Wrapper API**
Integrate all features into a unified API:
```clojure
(defn advanced-download
  "Advanced downloader with resumable downloads, progress tracking, and checksum verification."
  [url output-file progress-file chunk-size retries checksum algorithm]
  (let [progress (atom {:downloaded 0 :total (get-file-size url)})]
    (try
      ;; Resume if progress file exists
      (let [last-byte (get-last-byte progress-file)]
        (download-file url output-file chunk-size last-byte retries progress))
      ;; Verify checksum
      (verify-checksum output-file checksum algorithm)
      (println "Download completed successfully!")
      (catch Exception e
        (println "Download failed:" (.getMessage e))))))
```

---

### **Next Steps**
Would you like:
1. **A fully documented implementation of the advanced API?**
2. **Integration with your existing user-agent architecture?**
3. **Additional modules, such as torrent downloads or peer-to-peer support?**
<!-- LEVEL 3 -->
To enhance the download manager module for your browser with **all advanced capabilities**, including torrent downloads, peer-to-peer support, resumable downloads, and more, here's the architecture and implementation plan:

---

### **1. Enhanced Architecture for the Download Manager Module**

```

---

### **2. Feature Implementation Plan**

#### **A. HTTP/HTTPS Download Manager**
Already discussed, this includes **resumable downloads, multi-threading, proxy support, and retry strategies**.

---

#### **B. FTP/SFTP Download Manager**
Support for FTP and SFTP is vital for downloading files from legacy or secure servers.

- **Add Dependencies:**
  Use Java's `java.net` for FTP or libraries like [Apache Commons Net](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-net/) for better abstractions.

- **Example Implementation (FTP)**
```clojure
(require '[clojure.java.io :as io])
(import [org.apache.commons.net.ftp FTPClient])

(defn ftp-download
  "Downloads a file using FTP."
  [ftp-host file-path output-file]
  (let [client (FTPClient.)]
    (try
      (.connect client ftp-host)
      (.login client "anonymous" "")
      (with-open [input-stream (.retrieveFileStream client file-path)
                  output-stream (io/output-stream output-file)]
        (io/copy input-stream output-stream))
      (println "Download completed!")
      (.logout client)
      (.disconnect client))
      (catch Exception e
        (println "FTP download failed:" (.getMessage e))))))
```

---

#### **C. Torrent Download Manager**
Adding torrent support involves implementing or using existing BitTorrent libraries. For Clojure, you can interface with Java-based libraries like **jtorrent** or **aria2**.

- **Key Components of a Torrent Downloader:**
  - **Tracker Communication:** Retrieve peer information from the tracker.
  - **Piece Verification:** Verify each chunk of the file using SHA-1.
  - **Peer Connections:** Establish peer-to-peer connections.
  - **DHT Support:** Use a Distributed Hash Table to locate peers without a tracker.

- **Example (Using `jtorrent` for Simplicity)**
```clojure
(require '[clojure.java.shell :as shell])

(defn torrent-download
  "Downloads a file using torrent."
  [torrent-file output-dir]
  (let [command ["aria2c" "--enable-dht" "--dir" output-dir torrent-file]]
    (println "Starting torrent download...")
    (apply shell/sh command)))
```

---

#### **D. Peer-to-Peer Support (WebRTC Integration)**
WebRTC can enable decentralized file sharing and P2P downloads, critical for distributed systems and Web 3.0.

- **Add a WebRTC Client Library:**
  Use [ice4j](https://github.com/jitsi/ice4j) (Java WebRTC library) or integrate Clojure wrappers.

- **Establish Peer Connections:**
```clojure
(defn establish-webrtc-connection
  "Sets up a WebRTC connection for P2P file sharing."
  [peer-id]
  (let [rtc-connection (create-rtc-connection peer-id)]
    (on rtc-connection "data" handle-incoming-data)
    (println "WebRTC connection established with peer:" peer-id)
    rtc-connection)))
```

- **Data Transfer (Chunked):**
```clojure
(defn send-data-chunks
  "Sends data chunks to a peer."
  [rtc-connection data]
  (doseq [chunk (partition 1024 data)]
    (send rtc-connection chunk)))
```

---

#### **E. Metadata Management**
Handle download history, metadata, and integrity checks.

- **Download Metadata:**
  Store metadata like file name, size, checksum, and download progress in a database (e.g., SQLite, Datomic).

- **Checksum Example:**
```clojure
(defn save-metadata
  "Stores download metadata in a database."
  [metadata]
  (db/insert :downloads metadata))
```

- **Load Metadata:**
```clojure
(defn load-metadata
  "Retrieves metadata for resuming downloads."
  [download-id]
  (db/find :downloads {:id download-id}))
```

---

#### **F. Graphical User Interface**
Integrate a **download manager GUI** for progress tracking, error reporting, and user interaction.

- **Progress Bar:**
Use HumbleUI or JavaFX to show real-time download progress.

```clojure
(ns download.manager.gui
  (:require [humble-ui.core :as ui]))

(defn render-progress
  "Renders a progress bar for downloads."
  [progress]
  (ui/vstack
    (ui/label "Download Progress")
    (ui/progress-bar :value (:percentage progress))))
```

---

#### **G. Advanced Features**

1. **Retry with Dynamic Backoff:**
   Adjust retry delays based on server responses (e.g., using `Retry-After` headers).

2. **Parallel Chunk Downloads:**
   Optimize multi-threaded downloads by dynamically assigning threads to chunks.

3. **API Support:**
   Add a REST API for external tools or services to interact with the download manager.

---

### **Unified API for All Features**
```clojure
(defn advanced-download-manager
  "A comprehensive download manager supporting HTTP, FTP, Torrent, and P2P."
  [url options]
  (case (:protocol options)
    :http (parallel-download url (:output options) (:chunk-size options))
    :ftp (ftp-download (:host options) (:file-path options) (:output options))
    :torrent (torrent-download (:torrent-file options) (:output options))
    :p2p (establish-webrtc-connection (:peer-id options))
    (throw (Exception. "Unsupported protocol!"))))
```

---

### **Next Steps**
1. **Implement and Test:**
   Would you like detailed examples and testing strategies for each module?
2. **Integrate with the Browser:**
   Connect this download manager with your browser's user agent.
3. **Additional Features:**
   Would you like support for streaming media downloads, WebDAV, or CDN caching?


   <!-- LEvel end -->
   To further enhance the download manager, let's add **streaming media downloads**, **WebDAV**, **CDN caching**, and other features typical of media streaming. These features are integral for modern download managers, especially for handling media files (audio, video) and optimizing content delivery. Here’s how you can integrate them into your architecture:

---

### **1. Streaming Media Downloads**

For streaming media, you need to handle **partial file downloads**, **progressive downloads**, and **adaptive bitrate streaming**. These are essential for media playback (e.g., video/audio streams). 

**Key Features:**
- **Partial Range Requests:** Allow the client to request specific byte ranges (e.g., for video streaming).
- **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABR):** Select the best quality stream based on network conditions.
- **Streaming Protocol Support:** Implement HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH), or other protocols.

#### **Implementation Plan:**

##### **A. Range Requests for Streaming:**
```clojure
(require '[clojure.java.io :as io])
(import [java.net URL HttpURLConnection])

(defn range-request
  "Downloads a specific byte range from a media file for streaming."
  [url start-byte end-byte]
  (let [connection (.openConnection (URL. url))]
    (.setRequestProperty connection "Range" (str "bytes=" start-byte "-" end-byte))
    (.connect connection)
    (with-open [input-stream (.getInputStream connection)
                output-stream (io/output-stream "/tmp/partial-media-file")]
      (io/copy input-stream output-stream))
    (println "Partial media file downloaded!")))
```

##### **B. Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABR):**
Adaptive streaming can be implemented by fetching different media qualities based on bandwidth and buffering.

```clojure
(defn adaptive-bitrate-stream
  "Selects the best bitrate for streaming based on current conditions."
  [available-bitrates network-speed]
  (let [best-bitrate (first (filter #(<= (:min-speed %) network-speed) available-bitrates))]
    (if best-bitrate
      (download-media-file (:url best-bitrate))
      (println "Network speed too low for streaming"))))
```

Here, `available-bitrates` would contain various media qualities (e.g., 720p, 1080p), each associated with a minimum required network speed.

---

### **2. WebDAV Support**

WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning) is an extension of HTTP that allows clients to perform operations like creating, editing, and deleting files on remote servers. This can be used for managing files on cloud storage or remote servers.

#### **Key Features of WebDAV:**
- **File Management:** Supports file upload, download, delete, and move operations.
- **Folder Creation/Deletion:** Works like a file system on remote servers.
- **Secure Connections:** WebDAV usually works over HTTPS for secure file access.

#### **Implementation Plan:**

##### **A. WebDAV File Upload/Download:**
You can use a WebDAV client in Clojure with libraries like `clj-http` or Java's `HttpClient` to interact with WebDAV servers.

```clojure
(defn webdav-download
  "Downloads a file using WebDAV."
  [url target-file]
  (let [connection (HttpClient/newHttpClient)]
    (try
      (let [request (HttpRequest/newBuilder (URI. url))
            response (HttpClient/send request HttpResponse/BodyHandlers/ofString)]
        (spit target-file (.body response)))
      (catch Exception e
        (println "Error downloading file:" (.getMessage e))))))
```

##### **B. WebDAV File Management:**
```clojure
(defn webdav-create-dir
  "Creates a directory in WebDAV."
  [url dir-name]
  (let [connection (HttpClient/newHttpClient)]
    (try
      (let [request (HttpRequest/newBuilder (URI. (str url "/" dir-name)))
            response (HttpClient/send request HttpResponse/BodyHandlers/ofString)]
        (println "Directory created:" (.body response)))
      (catch Exception e
        (println "Error creating directory:" (.getMessage e))))))
```

---

### **3. CDN Caching**

CDN (Content Delivery Networks) caching is used to speed up file downloads by caching content closer to the user’s location.

**Key Features:**
- **Cache Control:** Implement cache headers like `Cache-Control` and `ETag` for efficient cache management.
- **Content Delivery:** Fetch content from the nearest server in the CDN.
- **Edge Caching:** Implement caching at the edge nodes of the network for faster delivery.

#### **Implementation Plan:**

##### **A. CDN Cache Support:**
```clojure
(defn check-cache
  "Checks if a file is cached or needs to be fetched from the server."
  [url file-path]
  (if (file-exists? file-path)
    (println "Using cached file!")
    (download-file-from-cdn url file-path)))
```

Here, the cache-checking mechanism will decide whether to use the local cache or request the file from the CDN.

##### **B. Cache-Control and ETag Headers:**
You can add support for cache validation by handling `Cache-Control` and `ETag` headers when downloading content.

```clojure
(require '[clojure.java.io :as io])
(import [java.net URL HttpURLConnection])

(defn download-with-cache-validation
  "Downloads a file, checking for cache validation using ETag and Cache-Control headers."
  [url cache-file]
  (let [connection (.openConnection (URL. url))]
    (if (.exists (io/file cache-file))
      (let [etag (.getHeaderField connection "ETag")
            cache-headers (.getHeaderField connection "Cache-Control")]
        (if (and etag (validate-etag etag cache-file))
          (println "Using cached file.")
          (download-file-from-url url cache-file)))
      (download-file-from-url url cache-file))))

(defn validate-etag
  "Validates the ETag header against the local file."
  [etag cache-file]
  ;; Compare the ETag value with the local file's stored value
  ;; (Implementation can depend on your system's caching strategy)
  true)
```

---

### **4. Additional Features:**

1. **Partial Downloads for Large Files:**
   Enable users to download only the necessary portions of large files to save bandwidth (e.g., audio/video streaming). You already have partial downloads with range requests.

2. **Support for DRM-Free Streaming:**
   Include integration for DRM-free content (e.g., from a public media server).

3. **File Integrity Check (Hash Validation):**
   Before or after the download, validate file integrity by comparing hash values (e.g., MD5/SHA1).

```clojure
(defn verify-file-integrity
  "Validates the integrity of a file by checking its hash."
  [file-path expected-hash]
  (let [actual-hash (calculate-hash file-path)]
    (if (= expected-hash actual-hash)
      (println "File integrity verified!")
      (println "File integrity check failed."))))

### **Next Steps**
1. **Testing and Validation:** Make sure each feature is robust and tested under real-world conditions, especially network speed, file sizes, and remote server configurations.
2. **Integration into the Browser:** Embed this advanced download manager into the browser as a core feature for media downloads, cloud file access, and peer-to-peer sharing.
3. **Error Handling & Recovery:** Add advanced error recovery strategies (e.g., automatic retries, multi-source downloads).

Would you like to proceed with detailed testing or integration strategies for any specific feature?

<!-- LEVEL Error -->
To ensure robustness in the **download manager**, **error handling and recovery** mechanisms are crucial. These systems need to handle various failure scenarios like network interruptions, invalid URLs, server errors, and file integrity issues. Here's how we can implement an error-handling and recovery strategy for this version.

### **Error Handling & Recovery Strategy**

---

### **1. Network Failure Recovery**
**Network failures** (e.g., DNS resolution issues, server unavailability, or connection timeouts) are common during file downloads. We can implement retries with exponential backoff and fallback mechanisms.

#### **Exponential Backoff Retry Mechanism**

Exponential backoff helps avoid overwhelming a server during transient failures. This strategy progressively increases the wait time between retries after each failed attempt.

```clojure
(defn exponential-backoff-retry
  "Retries a failed operation with exponential backoff."
  [max-retries delay-fn operation]
  (loop [retries 0]
    (try
      (operation)
      (catch Exception e
        (if (< retries max-retries)
          (do
            (println "Error occurred, retrying..." (.getMessage e))
            (Thread/sleep (delay-fn retries)) ;; Exponential delay
            (recur (inc retries)))
          (println "Max retries reached. Operation failed.")))))
```

- **`max-retries`**: Maximum number of retries.
- **`delay-fn`**: A function that calculates the delay (e.g., exponentially increasing delay).

Example: exponential backoff with 1000ms initial delay and a factor of 2 for each retry.

```clojure
(defn backoff-delay
  [retries]
  (* 1000 (Math/pow 2 retries)))
```

---

### **2. File Integrity Verification**
For **file integrity verification**, we can use checksums (e.g., MD5, SHA1) to ensure that the downloaded file matches the expected content. If the file’s integrity is compromised, we can trigger recovery operations.

```clojure
(defn calculate-hash
  "Calculates the hash (SHA256) of a file."
  [file-path]
  (let [digest (java.security.MessageDigest/getInstance "SHA-256")
        file-bytes (slurp file-path)]
    (-> digest
        (.update (.getBytes file-bytes))
        (.digest)
        (into-array Byte/TYPE))))

(defn verify-file-integrity
  "Validates the integrity of a file by checking its hash."
  [file-path expected-hash]
  (let [actual-hash (calculate-hash file-path)]
    (if (= expected-hash actual-hash)
      (println "File integrity verified!")
      (do
        (println "File integrity check failed. Retrying download...")
        ;; Initiate a retry or recovery process here
        (retry-download file-path)))))
```

---

### **3. Timeout Handling**
**Timeout handling** is necessary to avoid hanging the user’s download process. We can set specific timeouts for DNS resolution, server connections, and read timeouts.

#### **HTTP Timeout Example**
```clojure
(import [java.net URL HttpURLConnection])

(defn download-with-timeout
  "Handles file download with connection and read timeouts."
  [url timeout-ms output-file]
  (let [connection (.openConnection (URL. url))]
    (try
      (.setConnectTimeout connection timeout-ms) ;; Connection timeout
      (.setReadTimeout connection timeout-ms) ;; Read timeout
      (.connect connection)
      (with-open [input-stream (.getInputStream connection)
                  output-stream (clojure.java.io/output-stream output-file)]
        (clojure.java.io/copy input-stream output-stream))
      (println "Download completed."))
    (catch java.net.SocketTimeoutException e
      (println "Connection timed out. Retrying..."))
    (catch java.io.IOException e
      (println "I/O error occurred. Retrying..."))))
```

---

### **4. Handling Server Errors (4xx, 5xx HTTP Status Codes)**
When the server responds with an error (e.g., 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error), we should handle the error by attempting to retry after a short delay, or logging the error for the user.

#### **Example for 4xx and 5xx Errors**
```clojure
(defn handle-server-error
  "Handles HTTP server errors (4xx, 5xx) gracefully."
  [url response]
  (let [status-code (.getResponseCode response)]
    (cond
      (<= 400 status-code 499) ;; 4xx errors (client-side errors)
      (println "Client error occurred (4xx). Please check the URL or request.")
      
      (<= 500 status-code 599) ;; 5xx errors (server-side errors)
      (do
        (println "Server error occurred (5xx). Retrying...")
        (Thread/sleep 1000) ;; Wait for server recovery
        (retry-download url))
      
      :else
      (println "Download successful!"))))

(defn retry-download
  "Retries the download after an error."
  [url]
  (try
    (download-file url)
    (catch Exception e
      (println "Error during download:" (.getMessage e)))))
```

---

### **5. Retry Mechanism for Incomplete Downloads**
For large files, the connection might be interrupted, or the download might not complete. In this case, we can resume the download from where it was interrupted by using **partial file downloads**.

```clojure
(defn resume-download
  "Resumes a download from the last byte if interrupted."
  [url output-file]
  (let [file-size (file-length output-file)
        connection (.openConnection (URL. url))]
    (.setRequestProperty connection "Range" (str "bytes=" file-size "-"))
    (.connect connection)
    (with-open [input-stream (.getInputStream connection)
                output-stream (clojure.java.io/output-stream output-file :append true)]
      (clojure.java.io/copy input-stream output-stream))
    (println "Download resumed.")))

(defn file-length
  "Returns the length of a file."
  [file-path]
  (let [file (java.io.File. file-path)]
    (if (.exists file)
      (.length file)
      0)))
```

---

### **6. Error Logging**
A good download manager should log errors for debugging and recovery analysis.

```clojure
(defn log-error
  "Logs errors to a file for future troubleshooting."
  [error-message]
  (with-open [writer (clojure.java.io/writer "download-error.log" :append true)]
    (.write writer (str (java.time.LocalDateTime/now) " - " error-message "\n"))))

(defn log-retry
  "Logs retry attempts."
  [retry-count]
  (with-open [writer (clojure.java.io/writer "download-retries.log" :append true)]
    (.write writer (str "Retry #" retry-count " at " (java.time.LocalDateTime/now) "\n"))))
```

---

### **7. User Notifications**
Notify users when a retry occurs, or the download fails, so they are informed of the system's state.

```clojure
(defn notify-user
  "Notifies the user about download status."
  [status]
  (println (str "Download Status: " status)))
```

---

### **Final Error Handling Integration**

Now, integrate everything into a unified error-handling flow:

```clojure
(defn download-file
  "Handles file download with retries and error recovery."
  [url output-file]
  (exponential-backoff-retry 3 backoff-delay
    (fn []
      (try
        (download-with-timeout url 5000 output-file)
        (catch java.net.SocketTimeoutException e
          (println "Error: Timeout. Retrying...")
          (log-error "Timeout error"))
        (catch java.io.IOException e
          (println "Error: I/O exception. Retrying...")
          (log-error "I/O exception"))
        (catch Exception e
          (println "Unknown error. Retrying...")
          (log-error "Unknown error"))))))
```

---

### **Conclusion**

The system now supports the following error recovery and handling features:
1. **Exponential Backoff** for retries.
2. **Timeout Handling** for network and connection issues.
3. **File Integrity Verification** to ensure the file downloaded matches the expected content.
4. **Server Error Handling** (4xx/5xx HTTP responses).
5. **Resume Downloads** for large files, allowing interruption recovery.
6. **Error Logging** for debugging.
7. **User Notifications** to keep the user informed.

This error-handling mechanism ensures the download manager can reliably recover from common network errors and interruptions, making it production-ready.
